0. pip install django
1. create DJango project 
>django-admin startproject RegFirstProject

2. Now check (or verify) the folder where you have create the project....
in my computer I have created the same in D:\DJangoWorkshopProject\RegFirstProject
Here you will find Manage.py and project_folder (inside this you will find multiple (five) python files...)

What is the role of these python files:
manage.py: basic command utility file for django
__init__.py:__init__ is by default required here for initialization...and also to create a package and module
urls.py: for all possible urls or paths for our webpage
settings.py: for configuration setting

3. Check the server is working or not??
go inside the project folder...like....

>cd RegFirstProject
>RegFirstProject>python manage.py runserver

4. Now go to the browser and type http://127.0.0.1:8000/
you will see the text....."The install worked successfully! Congratulations!"
WebServer is started

5. if you want to stop your localhost web server..
type ctrl+c


Application in project: create new application inside the project
6. there are some python files required in our application
views.py: decides the user interface.....we will define different function here that will be called by URLS....such URLS are defined in url.py files

models.py: for define data model (or data settings)

form.py: it is required to create django form...like html form

7. go inside the project folder....run following command
Synatx:python manage.py startapp appname

python manage.py startapp RegFirstApp

inside the project folder a folder named as RegFirstApp will also be appeared it contains multiple python files...

8. after this open the settings.py iand add the above application as follows in application definition section..

# Application definition
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'RegFirstApp'             # ................this has been added

9. Now open the view.py file in editor
and write following statements in the file... after from django.shortcuts import render line

from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.

def Hello(request):
	msg="Welcome to my First Application"
	return HttpResponse(msg)

10. Now open the url.py from project folder
edit this file with some lines like as follows:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from RegFirstApp.views import Hello
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('Hello/',Hello)
]

here in line path('Hello/',Hello)....first Hello is for URL and second hello is for function which we have created in view.py

11. Now start the server with in project folder 
python manage.py runserver

12. Now check the application on web browser with following URL
http://127.0.0.1:8000/Hello/

you will see the function Hello is called now and the statement "Welcome to my First Application" will be appeared

Congratulation....now your first web application is perfectly working

13. Now we want a HTTP file...so that we can return content as response
create a folder named as "templates" in app folder
and then create html files in this folder only......

it means all sort of html files will be created only in template folder

14. Now create an index.html file in template folder like as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My HTML FILE</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>This is html file used by django View</h1>
</body>
</html>

15. now update the views .py file with new function

def index(request):
	return render(request,'index.html')

16. Now go to urls.py

from RegFirstApp.views import Hello,index
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('Hello/',Hello),
    path('index/',index) #....add this path after putting comma at the end of above statement

16. Now go to views.py
and update the index function as follows:

def index(request):
	return render(request,'index.html', {"name":"Anil Saroliya"})

also update the index.html file as follows:

<html>
<head>
	<title>My HTML FILE</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>This is html file used by django View</h1>
	<h1>User Name {{name}}</h1>
</body>
</html>

You will see on the webpage http://127.0.0.1:8000/index/ following output:
<make sure that your web server is already started if not then you have to start it again>
This is html file used by django View
User Name Anil Saroliya
......................................................................................................................................................................................
......................................................................................................................................................................................

Now we are going to work on usage of data models in django.....

database we are going to use sqllite already available with django framework

install dbbrowser for sqllite


17. Now open models.py file from app folder
update it as follows to create a table in database

class Student(models.Model):
	rollno=models.CharField(max_length=30)
	name=models.CharField(max_length=30)
	address=models.CharField(max_length=30)
	city=models.CharField(max_length=30)
	class Meta:
		db_table="Student"

18. Now goto the command prompt and type two commands

first command:
python manage.py makemigrations

.....it will generate the sql

and

second command:
python manage.py migrate

....it will apply the cahnegs in as commit in database


19. Now open the DB Browser go to OpenDatabase...now open the db.sqlite3 file in project folder
you will see the table which you have created

20. now we will insert the data in the table
open views.py file and update the following code

def savedata(request):
	r='R10001'
	n='Ajay'
	a='Gandhi Nagar'
	c='Mumbai'
	obj=Student(rollno=r,name=n,address=a,city=c)
	obj.save()
	msg="Data Saved Now"
	return HttpResponse(msg)

also import the following model on the top in the same file:

from RegFirstApp.models import Student


21.  update following two lines in urls.py file respectively

from RegFirstApp.views import Hello,index,savedata
path('savedata/',savedata)

20. Now restart the web server again and open http://127.0.0.1:8000/savedata/ in browser
21. you can check the table is updated in database on DB Browser

22. now update the views.py as follows for fetching the data from database 

def showdata(request):
	obj=Student.objects.all() # return all record
	msg="Data...<br>"
	for res in obj:
		msg=msg+res.rollno+"<br>"
		msg=msg+res.name+"<br>"
		msg=msg+res.address+"<br>"
		msg=msg+res.city+"<br>"
	return HttpResponse(msg)

23. Now update the urls.py as follows:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from RegFirstApp.views import Hello,index,savedata,showdata
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('Hello/',Hello),
    path('index/',index),
    path('savedata/',savedata),
    path('showdata/',showdata)
]

24. to update the database table, add following function in views.py and also update the urls.py acccordingly

def updatedata(request):
	obj=Student.objects.get(rollno='R10001') # return all record
	obj.name='Mukesh Kumar'
	obj.address='Rajastha-Jaipur'
	obj.city='Jaipur City'
	obj.save()
	msg="Record Updated"
	return HttpResponse(msg)

add following two lines urls.py
from RegFirstApp.views import Hello,index,savedata,showdata,updatedata
path('updatedata/',updatedata)


you can now broswe the following url http://127.0.0.1:8000/updatedata/...the data will be updated in database

after that you can check the updated data in database through http://127.0.0.1:8000/showdata/

Data...
R10001
Mukesh Kumar
Rajastha-Jaipur
Jaipur City

25. similarly we can delete the data through following function in views.py

def deletedata(request):
	obj=Student.objects.get(rollno='R10001')
	obj.delete()
	msg="Record deleted"
	return HttpResponse(msg)

also update the urls.data as follows:
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from RegFirstApp.views import Hello,index,savedata,showdata,updatedata,deletedata
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('Hello/',Hello),
    path('index/',index),
    path('savedata/',savedata),
    path('showdata/',showdata),
    path('updatedata/',updatedata),
    path('deletedata/',deletedata)
]
